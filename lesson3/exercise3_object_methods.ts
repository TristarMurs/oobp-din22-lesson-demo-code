/* Create an class for school courses. The course objects should have the following properties:

    name – string
    maxStudents - number
    startDate – string
    endDate – string */

/* Modify the class so that every object includes a method
   which can be used to print the course start and end date to the console in one string:
   "Course starts: <startDate>, course ends: <endDate>" */

/* Initialize an array with 5 course objects */

/* Write a loop which prints the course start and end date for all the courses in the array */
